/* The for principles of "this";
* in your own words. explain the four principle for the "this" keyword below.
*
* 1. Window Binding is just an object that will always be in the global scope
* 2. Implicit binding is when a dot is between "this" and a word in a function
* 3. New Binding is when a constructor function is used which is when a function 
returns an object. The new object from that is what the new binding is talking about.
* 4. Explicit Binding is when .call .bind or .apply are added to the function
*
* write out a code example of each explanation above
